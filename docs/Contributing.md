# Using Obsidian For Contribution

!!! note

    Using Obsidian is the recommended method for contributing to this site.

Obsidian is an excellent tool for contributing to the documentation — it provides a streamlined, Markdown-focused interface that allows you to concentrate on content creation. Whether you're on mobile or desktop, you can use Obsidian with community plugins to enhance the workflow.

----

## Using Obsidian On Mobile

To contribute using Obsidian on mobile:

1. **Download Obsidian**:
   - Download Obsidian from your app store ([iOS or Android](https://obsidian.md)).

2. **Set Up Community Plugins**:
   - Open Obsidian and click on `Settings` (gear icon).
   - Enable third-party plugins:
     - Go to `Options` > `Community Plugins` and enable the feature.
   - Install the following plugins:
     - **Git**: Allows you to push and pull changes to the repository.
     - **Templates**: Enables you to create consistent content using predefined templates.

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Use the Git plugin to clone the docs repository. Add your repository URL during setup.
   - Assign the cloned repository to a vault in Obsidian.

4. **Contribute**:
   - Open the Markdown file(s) you want to edit within your Obsidian vault.
   - Use the Templates plugin to insert the page template or other predefined snippets.
   - Make your changes, then save.

5. **Commit and Push**:
   - Use the Git plugin to commit your changes with a descriptive message.
   - Push your changes upstream to submit a pull request via GitHub.

## Using Obsidian On Desktop

To contribute using Obsidian on desktop:

1. **Download and Install Obsidian**:
   - Download the Obsidian desktop app from [Obsidian's website](https://obsidian.md/).

2. **Set Up Community Plugins**:
   - Open Obsidian and navigate to `Settings` (gear icon).
   - Enable third-party plugins:
     - Go to `Community Plugins` and toggle the feature on.
   - Install the necessary plugins:
     - **Git**: Push and pull changes directly from Obsidian.
     - **Templates**: Use preformatted templates for consistency in your contributions.

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   - If you already have Git installed:
     - Clone the repository:
       ```bash
       git clone <repo_url>
       ```
     - Open the cloned folder as an Obsidian vault.
   - Alternatively, use the Git plugin to clone the repository directly in Obsidian.

4. **Create or Edit Content**:
   - Navigate to the Markdown files you want to edit.
   - Use the Templates plugin to insert the required structure for pages or content.

5. **Review Changes Locally**:
   - Use the `mkdocs` commands provided in the "Editing Docs Locally" section to build and preview your changes.

6. **Commit and Push**:
   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message using the Git plugin.
   - Push to your branch and open a pull request on GitHub.

## Why Use Obsidian With These Plugins?

- **Git Plugin**: Simplifies the process of keeping your local edits synced with the repository.
- **Templates Plugin**: Ensures consistency in the format and style of your contributions by using the templates fokder.

By leveraging Obsidian and these two plugins, you can create a smooth editing experience that integrates seamlessly with the documentation workflow.

## Suggested workflow (Without Obsidian)

!!! warning

    This method of contributing to the site is not preferred, may lead to issues, and is only accessible on desktop devices.

- Use the **Edit this page** link on any documentation page to propose documentation changes. That opens the source file on GitHub — make an edit and submit a pull request.
- For large or code changes, fork the repo, create a branch named `fix/<short-description>` or `feat/<short-description>`, make your changes, then open a pull request against `main`.
- Include a clear PR description with what you changed and why, and link any relevant issues.

## Pull request guidelines

- Target branch: `main`.
- Use descriptive, imperative commit messages (e.g., "Fix broken command example").
- If your change affects behavior or API, add tests or instructions for reviewers to verify.

## Editing docs locally

- Use the page template at [basic-template](/Templates/basic-template/) when creating a new documentation page.

----

1. Create and activate a Python venv in the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Build or serve the docs locally:

```bash
python -m mkdocs build
# or for live reload
mkdocs serve
```

4. After editing Markdown files, run `mkdocs build` to check the site builds and review changes at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` when using `mkdocs serve`.

## Coding style & tests

- Follow existing code style in the repository. Keep changes minimal and focused.
- Run existing tests where applicable and include instructions in your PR if special steps are needed.

## Reporting issues or requesting help

- Open an issue at: {{ config.repo_url }}/issues
- Join the support Discord (see the Links page) if you need live help.

## License and contributor agreement

By submitting a pull request you agree to the repository's license and that your contribution will be made available under the same license.
